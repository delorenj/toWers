# Toast Notification Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Critical Issue: TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY**
- **Problem**: The toast auto-dismiss delay was set to `1000000` ms (16.67 minutes)
- **Fix**: Changed to `5000` ms (5 seconds)
- **File**: `/hooks/use-toast.ts`

### 2. **Added Duration Support**
- Added `duration` prop to `ToasterToast` type
- Modified `addToRemoveQueue` to accept custom duration
- Updated toast function to use duration and auto-dismiss
- Default duration is 5 seconds, but can be customized per toast

### 3. **Dual Toast Libraries**
- The app uses both custom toast (`useToast`) and Sonner
- Custom toast appears at top-right (desktop) / top (mobile)
- Sonner appears at bottom-right
- Both are rendered in the root layout

## Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to `/test-toast` to see the test page
2. Try the different toast buttons to verify:
   - Custom toasts now auto-dismiss after their duration
   - Both toast systems work independently
   - Different durations work correctly

## Recommendation

Consider standardizing on one toast library:
- **Option 1**: Remove Sonner and use only the custom toast implementation
- **Option 2**: Migrate all components to use Sonner and remove the custom implementation

This would avoid confusion and ensure consistent user experience.

## Files Modified
- `/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Fixed auto-dismiss delay and added duration support
- `/app/(sidebar-layout)/(container)/test-toast/page.tsx` - Created test page

## Next Steps
1. Test the notifications throughout the app
2. Decide on which toast library to keep
3. Migrate all usages to the chosen library
