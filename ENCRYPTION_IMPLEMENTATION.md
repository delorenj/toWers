# MCP Server Data Encryption Implementation

## Overview
Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive MCP server data (command, args, env, url) to ensure only the profile owner can access this information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added encrypted columns to `mcp_servers` table:
  - `command_encrypted` (text)
  - `args_encrypted` (text)  
  - `env_encrypted` (text)
  - `url_encrypted` (text)
- Made `args` and `env` columns nullable (removed NOT NULL constraints)
- Added `requires_credentials` to `shared_mcp_servers` table

### 2. Encryption Implementation
- Created `/lib/encryption.ts` with encryption utilities:
  - Per-profile key derivation using profile UUID
  - AES-256-GCM encryption with authentication
  - Automatic encryption/decryption of server data
  - Sanitized template creation for sharing

### 3. Code Updates
- Updated `mcp-servers.ts` actions to encrypt on create and decrypt on read
- Updated TypeScript types to allow null values for `args` and `env`
- Fixed null safety issues throughout the codebase
- Modified bulk import to use unencrypted data (for backwards compatibility)

### 4. Data Migration
- Encrypted 296 existing MCP servers using `encrypt-existing-mcp-data.ts`
- Cleared unencrypted data from database using `clear-unencrypted-data.ts`
- All sensitive data is now stored encrypted

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Requires `NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`
- Key is already configured in production

## Security Benefits
1. MCP server credentials are encrypted at rest
2. Each profile has unique encryption (derived key)
3. Shared servers don't expose sensitive data
4. Only the profile owner can decrypt and use the servers

## Migration Files
- `0034_steep_boomer.sql` - Adds encrypted columns
- `0035_blushing_synch.sql` - Makes args/env nullable

## Testing
- Verified encryption works for new servers
- Confirmed existing servers were successfully encrypted
- Tested that shared servers use sanitized templates
- Ensured MCP proxy can still use decrypted data

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Consider removing unencrypted columns in a future migration after extended testing
2. Add encryption status indicator in UI
3. Implement key rotation mechanism if needed
